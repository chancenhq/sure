Personal Onboarding Workflow

Last updated: Jan 28

# Personal Onboarding Workflow​

Modified January 28

Backgroud​

There are two types of individual accounts:​

1\. Wallet account​

2\. Current account​

The difference in an onboarding sense is the type of KYC required, the current account requires more documents to be submitted.​

This guide is to walk you through opening both accounts.​

​

​

After doing this successfully, you need to now submit the photos of the ID and a selfie video of the customer:​

​

​

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Definition​ | Interface to upload the required document for onboarding. ​ | ​ | ​ |

​

​

💡

You do not need to submit a selfie photo, the system grabs a screenshot from the submitted selfie video.​

​

After all documents are successfully uploaded, the system will automatically process the documents. This will either pass successfully or go to manual review. You will receive a 0001 webhook notification confirming the status.​

​

💡

No OTP confirmation is needed for the current account​

​

Conclusion​

You're now familiar with our individual account onboarding. You're now free to play with all other endpoints to perform operation on this account. ​

Happy coding!!​
